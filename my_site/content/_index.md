I’m a Biostatistics PhD candidate at <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics">Johns Hopkins</a>, 
where I work with <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1442/ciprian-m-crainiceanu">Ciprian Crainiceanu</a> 
and the <a href="https://www.smart-stats.org/">Wearable and Implantable Technology (WIT)</a> research group. 
My interests include methods for processing + analysis of wearable device and other high density data,
and physical activity + human performance research.

<p>I was born and raised in Orono, Maine. I got my undergraduate degree in Statistics at 
<a href="https://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard</a> and my Master’s degree in Biostatistics at the 
<a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/">Harvard School of Public Health</a>. At Harvard, I competed on and captained the 
<a href="https://gocrimson.com/sports/alpine-skiing/roster/lily-koffman/8198">Nordic ski team</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, I worked for <a href="https://usskiandsnowboard.org/">US Ski and Snowboard</a> as a high performance intern 
and <a href="https://www.womeninsportstech.org/fellowship-alumni">Women in Sports Technology (WiST) Fellow.</a></p>

In my free time, I enjoy running, skiing, cycling, camping, and baking sourdough.
