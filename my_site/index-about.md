I’m a biostatistician developing methods to process and analyze wearable device data, including accelerometry and hemodynamics. My work is problem-driven and collaborative, with applications in physical activity, epidemiology, and cardiac surgery, alongside <a href="http://www.ciprianstats.org/">Ciprian Crainiceanu</a> and the Wearable and Implantable Technology (WIT) research group.
<p>I was born and raised in Orono, Maine. I got my undergraduate degree in Statistics at 
<a href="https://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard</a>, where I captained the <a href="https://gocrimson.com/sports/alpine-skiing/roster/lily-koffman/8198">Nordic ski team</a>, and my Master’s degree in Biostatistics at the 
<a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/">Harvard School of Public Health</a>. Previously, I worked for <a href="https://usskiandsnowboard.org/">US Ski and Snowboard</a> as a high performance intern and <a href="https://www.womeninsportstech.org/fellowship-alumni">Women in Sports Technology (WiST) Fellow.</a></p>
